			<h2 class="trans">So This is your Family time</h2>
			<p class="tran" text-size="40px">
				Well you are very well aware that you don't have a single family. One family looked after you and brought you up (Pradhan family)
				& the other helped you grow alot, (OC Family). Today your mom,dad,shk(shaunak), grandparents are so happy that you entered their life 20 years back. And why won't they be? Such an affable and mirthful character you are. You always were that matured kiddo who always understood the problems and learned to solve them with sincerity and smile. "Manu" , eh that's your nickname right,shb? Um, they are just wonderful and most closest to your heart, so what else say? <3
				
				</p>
				<p class="tran">Yes you had so many beautiful moments right from your birth, to your school days, to your college and finally you reached here.
				And don't be lazy to miss out on reading anything special. Bitch, I know you have skipped many words already. 
				I know you hated OC alot at the start, and you were so clueless about it's functioning as well, and you also know that you shall be so very proud of yourself for whatever you achieved in this tenure. You went through having no friends to actually having an entire family standing up for you. You were scared, that you would end up being a nerd here (oops flashback) and then you met someone really annoying. But it's alright, that's how the journey becomes more and more memorable. Thank God I fought for you and brought you in OC, orelse I doubt we would have ever met.
